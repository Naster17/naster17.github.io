## TL;DR
- Write pure Assembly and C code for Arduino
- Make the firmware 20 times smaller!
- Setup avr utils in your linux environment

## Get Started
Today we're going to dive into low-level programming on a platform like Arduino, and especially avr.
Let's go all the way from vanilla C++ programming to low-level Assembly. 
And this will lead us to reduce our firmware by as much as 20 times.

I will use **Arduno Nano** and **Arduino Uno**
